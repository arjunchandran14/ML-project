Predicting Loan Defaults in Banking: Developing an ML Model to Mitigate Losses"

This problem involves leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data on loan applications, customer profiles, and economic indicators to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their loan. By accurately identifying high-risk borrowers early in the process, banks can take proactive measures such as adjusting interest rates, modifying repayment terms, or denying loans to mitigate potential losses. This project aims to optimize the bank's lending process, improve risk management strategies, and ultimately reduce financial losses due to loan defaults.

Project Workflow
Data Collection: Gather various attributes related to loans and borrowers, including financial details, credit history, employment information, and loan performance.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of variables, relationships, and potential patterns related to loan default.

Feature Engineering: Create or transform features that can improve the predictive power of the model.

Model Building: Train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting the probability of default. Common models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.

Model Evaluation: Use the metrics to assess the model's performance.

Model Deployment: If the model performs well, consider deploying it for real-time credit risk assessment.

Documentation and Reporting: Document the project's findings, including model performance, insights from EDA, and recommendations for risk management.
